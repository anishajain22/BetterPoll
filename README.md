# BetterPoll
A secure, reliable and transparent system for elections and referanda.


Blockchain technology is now used in various sectors around the world such as banking, healthcare, supply chains, etc. But it also has huge potential for conducting online elections. The technology can help implement fair and secure elections, cut costs and increase voter turnout. Blockchain technology offers more security, than a simple server vulnerable to hacking and polling booths becoming bullying spots. A blockchain is a database controlled by all the network members and not just by a single entity such as a bank or government agency. 

When the blockchain conversation turns to voting, each transaction involves a vote being received rather than cryptocurrency being exchanged. Those with access to the voting process can add their votes to a blockchain where their choice is safeguarded and transparent. Of course, another important element of any voting system is voter anonymity.

In the blockchain, there is a smart contract for encrypted voting. A smart contract is associated with the so-called encryption key, which is necessary for encrypting and then decrypting votes. After the encrypted voting starts, the public key is published in the smart contract by the BetterPoll and is made available to verified voters, while the private key will be used to change the vote casted until the deadline of voting and to check the contract of the constituency. When voting, the system will automatically load this data and encrypt the votes.

The monitoring function will be available to all interested participants, even if they have minimal technical knowledge because something as basic as voting should be made available to all irrespective of the technical and societal differences.
